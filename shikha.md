Hello everyone, My name is Shikha Rajpoot and I'm pursuing B.C.A. from IIMT Aligarh.
I like to read and learn new things related to my field of interest.Apart from these I also like to read novels of different genre.
Recently I started learning Java Programming language after I've learnt C and C++. I also know basics of HTML and CSS 
as I want to be a Front End Developer. I'm keen to learn and explore many things.Being a part of Girlscript, has opened new
opportunity for me to learn and explore and I'm happy to be a part of it.

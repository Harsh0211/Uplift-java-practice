In the above image it can be seen that the part highlighted with the red box is the MAIN MENU which displays USER NAME & USER ID at the top.
The function call using the instance **obj** to the function **showMenu()** will result in the display of the MAIN MENU as shown in the image.

The part which is highlighted with the green box is where the USER inputs his/her desired choice of option.

The part highlighted with the blue box indicates that the USER has chose to EXIT the MAIN MENU by entering the option E or e which results in the exiting the MAIN MENU.
Thus,printing the last statement **Thank You.Have a nice day!**.Hence, the program ends.
